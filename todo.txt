possibly use gevent for nonblocking IOs to send server data from the client
use the sha256 algorithm described here http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html except transcribe so that this works with opencl
write a script that queues things into the redis queue of data to analyze
      for bitcoins write a python script that enumerates all strings to be hashed and upload to redis
      for image filtering write a script that enumerates all of the images
          for image filtering we only have latency cost, should still be able to achieve filtering and returning images in real time
